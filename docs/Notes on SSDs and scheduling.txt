Why scheduling still matters on SSDs

1️⃣ SSDs still have finite internal parallelism
 * Limited queue depth
 * Limited write buffers
 * Garbage collection pauses
 * Unscheduled access can collapse latency.

2️⃣ Writes interfere with reads (a lot)
 * SSD firmware does erase + rewrite internally
 * Large write streams can spike read latency
 * Scheduling isolates workloads

3️⃣ Page cache & writeback pressure
 * Dirty page writeback is I/O
 * Background flushers can starve foreground reads
 * BFQ prevents writeback storms from dominating

4️⃣ Multi-tenant fairness
 * On a container host:
 * One container doing logging
 * Another serving queries
 * Without scheduling:
 * Logs can stall queries
 * With io.weight:
 * Queries stay responsive

5️⃣ Latency > throughput for most apps
 * 99% of services care about:
 * p95 / p99 latency
 * tail behavior
