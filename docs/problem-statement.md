**Signals from the JD:**

 1. Strong isolation guarantees
 2. Isolation stronger than “best-effort” containers
 3. Highly performant… arbitrary code execution
 4. Provision and operate high density compute
 5. Efficient load balancing and resource utilization
 6. Troubleshoot complex infrastructure issues
 7. Explicit admission control
 8. Deterministic scheduling decisions
 9. Fast, visible backpressure
 10. Failure semantics that are easy to reason about
 11. GPU-first placement logic
