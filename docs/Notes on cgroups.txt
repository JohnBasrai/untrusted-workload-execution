* cgroup v2 exposes effective controller values per cgroup, and
  io.stat reports I/O usage per block device using standard Linux
  major:minor numbering.

* /sys/fs/cgroup is not a real directory
  /sys/fs is a virtual filesystem (sysfs + cgroupfs), backed by kernel objects, not disk blocks.
  What that means concretely
    No inodes on disk
    No persistence across reboot
    Files are generated on read
    Writes are commands to the kernel

* It is a structured RPC interface disguised as a filesystem

* /sys/fs/cgroup is a virtual kernel interface, not disk-backed storage.

* NVMe devices are PCIe-attached flash exposed as block devices with
  massive parallelism.
